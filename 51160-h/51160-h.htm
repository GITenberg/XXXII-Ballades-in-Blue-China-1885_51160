<h2><i>A BALLADE OF XXXII BALLADES</i>.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><i>Friend</i>, <i>when you bear a care-dulled
eye</i>,<br />
<i>And brow perplexed with things of weight</i>,<br />
<i>And fain would bid some charm untie</i><br />
<i>The bonds that hold you all too strait</i>,<br />
<i>Behold a solace to your fate</i>,<br />
<i>Wrapped in this cover&rsquo;s china blue</i>;<br />
<i>These ballades fresh and delicate</i>,<br />
<i>This dainty troop of Thirty-two</i>!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>The mind</i>, <i>unwearied</i>, <i>longs to
fly</i><br />
<i>And commune with the wise and great</i>;<br />
<i>But that same ether</i>, <i>rare and high</i>,<br />
<i>Which glorifies its worthy mate</i>,<br />
<i>To breath forspent is disparate</i>:<br />
<i>Laughing and light and airy-new</i><br />
<i>These come to tickle the dull pate</i>,<br />
<i>This dainty troop of Thirty-two</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="pageii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ii</span><i>Most welcome then</i>, <i>when you and I</i>,<br />
<i>Forestalling days for mirth too late</i>,<br />
<i>To quips and cranks and fantasy</i><br />
<i>Some choice half-hour dedicate</i>,<br />
<i>They weave their dance with measured rate</i><br />
<i>Of rhymes enlinked in order due</i>,<br />
<i>Till frowns relax and cares abate</i>,<br />
<i>This dainty troop of Thirty-two</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Envoy</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Princes</i>, <i>of toys that please your
state</i><br />
<i>Quainter are surely none to view</i><br />
<i>Than these which pass with tripping gait</i>,<br />
<i>This dainty troop of Thirty-two</i>.</p>

<p class="poetry">Ah! leave the smoke, the wealth, the roar<br />
Of London, and the bustling street,<br />
For still, by the Sicilian shore,<br />
The murmur of the Muse is sweet.<br />
Still, still, the suns of summer greet<br />
The mountain-grave of Helik&ecirc;,<br />
And shepherds still their songs repeat<br />
Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">What though they worship Pan no more,<br />
That guarded once the shepherd&rsquo;s seat,<br />
They chatter of their rustic lore,<br />
They watch the wind among the wheat:<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Cicalas
chirp, the young lambs bleat,<br />
Where whispers pine to cypress tree;<br />
They count the waves that idly beat<br />
Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">Theocritus! thou canst restore<br />
The pleasant years, and over-fleet;<br />
With thee we live as men of yore,<br />
We rest where running waters meet:<br />
And then we turn unwilling feet<br />
And seek the world&mdash;so must it be&mdash;<br />
<i>We</i> may not linger in the heat<br />
Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">ENVOY.</p>
<p class="poetry">Master,&mdash;when rain, and snow, and sleet<br

And northern winds are wild, to thee<br />
We come, we rest in thy retreat,<br />
Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea!</p>

Look down, if look ye may, and scan<br />
This monument in London mist!</p>
<p class="poetry">Behold, the hieroglyphs are dumb<br />
That once were read of him that ran<br />
When seistron, cymbal, trump, and drum<br />
Wild music of the Bull began;<br />
When through the chanting priestly clan<br />
Walk&rsquo;d Ramses, and the high sun kiss&rsquo;d<br />
This stone, with blessing scored and ban&mdash;<br />

Though human effort, plot, and plan<br />

<p class="poetry">The hours are passing slow,<br />
I hear their weary tread<br />
Clang from the tower, and go<br />
Back to their kinsfolk dead.<br />
Sleep! death&rsquo;s twin brother dread!<br />
Why dost thou scorn me so?<br />
The wind&rsquo;s voice overhead<br />
Long wakeful here I know,<br />
And music from the steep<br />
Where waters fall and flow.<br />
Wilt thou not hear me, Sleep?</p>
<p class="poetry">All sounds that might bestow<br />
Rest on the fever&rsquo;d bed,<br />
All slumb&rsquo;rous sounds and low<br />
Are mingled here and wed,<br />

flit to and fro<br />
With shadowy hair dispread;<br />
With wistful eyes that glow,<br />

Thou wilt not hear me; no?<br />
Wilt thou not hear me, Sleep?</p>
<p class="poetry">What cause hast thou to show<br />
Of sacrifice unsped?<br />
Of all thy slaves below<br />
I most have labour&egrave;d<br />
With service sung and said;<br />
Have cull&rsquo;d such buds as blow,<br />
Soft poppies white and red,<br />

More than her hounds that follow on the flight;<br />
The goddess draws a golden bow of might<br />
And thick she rains the gentle shafts that slay.<br />

<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis thought Odysseus when the strife was
o&rsquo;er<br />
With all the waves and wars, a weary while,<br />
Grew restless in his disenchanted isle,<br />
And still would watch the sunset, from the shore,<br />
Go down the ways of gold, and evermore<br />
His sad heart followed after, mile on mile,<br />
Back to the Goddess of the magic wile,<br />
Calypso, and the love that was of yore.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou too, thy haven gained, must turn thee
yet<br />
To look across the sad and stormy space,<br />
Years of a youth as bitter as the sea,<br />
Ah, with a heavy heart, and eyelids wet,<br />
Because, within a fair forsaken place<br />
The life that might have been is lost to thee.</p>

Around the isles enchanted; nay, to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy verse seems as the River of source unknown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That glasses Egypt&rsquo;s temples overthrown<br />
In his sky-nurtured stream, eternally.</p>
<p class="poetry">No wiser we than men of heretofore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To find thy sacred fountains guarded fast;<br />
Enough, thy flood makes green our human shore,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The song that all about the world must go,&mdash;<br

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
